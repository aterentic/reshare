# Privacy Policy

**ReShare - Document Converter**

Last updated: 2025-02-06

## Overview

ReShare is a document conversion app that runs entirely on your device. Your privacy is respected by design: the app does not collect, transmit, or share any data.

## Data Processing

All document conversion is performed locally on your device using the Pandoc engine bundled with the app. No files are uploaded to any server. No network requests are made during normal app operation.

## Data Collection

ReShare does **not** collect:

- Personal information
- Usage analytics or telemetry
- Crash reports
- Device identifiers
- Location data

## Local Storage

The app stores the following data locally on your device:

- **Conversion history**: A record of past conversions (file names, formats, timestamps) stored in a local SQLite database. This data never leaves your device and can be cleared at any time through the app settings.
- **Temporary files**: Intermediate files created during conversion are stored in the app's private cache directory and cleaned up automatically.

## Third-Party Services

ReShare does not integrate with any third-party services, SDKs, or analytics platforms.

## Network Access

The app does not require network access. The Pandoc binary and its dependencies are bundled at build time, not downloaded at runtime.

## Children's Privacy

ReShare does not collect any data from any user, including children.

## Changes to This Policy

Any changes to this privacy policy will be reflected in app updates and documented here.
