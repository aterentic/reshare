# Backlog

Future ideas and improvements - not currently planned.

## UI / Theming
- Migrate from XML layouts to Jetpack Compose (requires toolchain upgrade first)

## PDF Input Enhancements
- Image extraction from PDFs (pdftohtml `-i` flag currently ignores images)
- Scanned PDF detection and user warning (OCR-only PDFs produce empty output)

## Build
- Upgrade to AGP 10.0 when stable (track Android Studio Meerkat feature drops)

## Distribution
- First GitHub release: keystore setup, tag `v1.0`, signed APK → [keystore](specs/keystore-setup.md)
- F-Droid release
- Play Store release

## Platform
- iOS port
